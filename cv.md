## About me:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to be interested in programming as a teenager. I was tooking
at it rather as a hobby, a passion that allowed me to develop and gain
new onesskills. At some point I came to the conclusion, that what I like
can become mine way of life. I am actualy looking for my first job in the
IT (prefered skils JS / React Development), where I will be able to
work with people with similar interests and expand my experience.
